        <div class="description">
            <p>Hi! I am <strong>Robert Angelo S. Marquez</strong>, a <strong>3rd year Computer Engineering Technology</strong> student of <strong>TUP Manila.</strong> I can describe myself as an easy going, responsible, helpful and creative person. My friends call me as a social butterfly since I do get along with a lot of people. I have a huge dream of establishing myself as a professional fullstack web developer someday. At this point, I enjoy front - end development using HTML, CSS and javascript. I can also consider myself as a musically inclined person. I sing and play several instruments at times. I compose my own songs too whenever I feel doing so.</p>

        <div class="text2">
            <p>Ever since I was around 8 years old, I have dealt with computers. I've always been amazed on how things work on the screen. Since then, I explored both software and hardware and growing up, I became more knowledgeable about it. I find dealing with computers stressful yet fun. From basic troubleshooting when I was a kid, I can now repair and maintain stuff. At this point, I want to learn programming. This interest in me made me choose this course.</p>
